        "nose": "Maritime notes, with brine, sea-spray and iodine taking the lead. Behind this there is a gentle bonfire smoke. With time in the glass, this smokiness becomes sweeter, with grilled pineapple emerging.",
        "palate": "Rich and mouth-filling, with an initial honeyed sweetness that quickly gives way to peppery spice. The smoke is present, but more controlled than on the nose. Caramel, vanilla, and citrus fruit flavors develop.",
        "finish": "Long, warming, with gentle smoke and spice lingering. A hint of salted toffee at the very end.",

        "nose": "A delicate balance of sweet fruit and malty notes. Apples, pears, and a hint of tropical fruit are complemented by cinnamon and clove spices. There's an underlying creamy vanilla quality.",
        "palate": "Medium-bodied and smooth. The fruity notes from the nose continue, with added layers of honey, soft oak, and a touch of ginger. Light pepper adds complexity without overwhelming.",
        "finish": "Medium-long, with the fruit giving way to a drying oak spice. Pleasantly warming with a subtle hint of cocoa at the very end.",
